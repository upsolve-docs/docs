## Overview

Data permissioning in Upsolve AI ensures that each end user only sees the data that's relevant and authorized for them. This is essential for multi-tenant applications where you need to provide secure, isolated data access across different customers, organizations, or user groups.

## Core Concepts

### Multi-Tenancy
Upsolve AI supports **multi-tenancy** out of the box, allowing you to serve multiple customers or organizations from a single deployment while ensuring complete data isolation between them.

### Tenants

A **Tenant** represents a distinct group of end users that share the same data access permissions and filters. In practice, tenants typically correspond to:

- **Organizations or Companies**: Each customer organization gets their own tenant
- **User Groups**: Different departments within the same company
- **Geographic Regions**: Regional data access requirements
- **Permission Levels**: Admin vs. standard user access

## How Data Permissioning Works

### 1. Tenant Registration
When users authenticate in your application, you register them as tenants with Upsolve using the [register-tenant endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/register-tenant-to-upsolve). This process:

- Associates users with their tenant identity
- Defines what data they can access via prefilters
- Issues a secure JWT for dashboard access

### 2. Prefilters and Data Isolation
**Prefilters** are automatically applied filters that restrict data access based on tenant properties. For example:

```json
{
  "company_id": "acme-corp",
  "region": "us-west",
  "access_level": "standard"
}
```

These filters ensure that:
- Users from "acme-corp" only see their company's data
- Regional restrictions are enforced
- Access levels control data sensitivity

### 3. Dashboard-Level Security
Once registered, tenants access dashboards through secure URLs that:
- Validate their JWT token
- Apply tenant-specific prefilters
- Render data relevant to their permissions

## Key Benefits

## Implementation Flow

To implement data permissioning in your embedded BI setup:

1. **[Set up Tenancy Management](/embedded-bi/data-permissioning/tenancy-management)** - Understand tenant concepts and configuration
2. **[Configure Tenant Properties](/embedded-bi/data-permissioning/tenant-properties)** - Define the data fields for filtering
3. **[Backend Setup](/embedded-bi/deploy-dashboards/backend-setup)** - Implement tenant registration in your auth flow
4. **[Frontend Integration](/embedded-bi/deploy-dashboards/frontend-setup)** - Embed dashboards with tenant context

## Best Practices

### Tenant Design
- **Keep it Simple**: Start with basic company/user ID filtering
- **Plan for Growth**: Design tenant structure that scales with your business
- **Performance**: Use indexed columns for prefilter fields

### Security
- **Validate Everything**: Never trust client-side tenant information
- **Regular Audits**: Review tenant access patterns periodically
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Give users minimum necessary access

### Development
- **Test Thoroughly**: Verify data isolation between tenants
- **Monitor Performance**: Track query performance with tenant filters
- **Document Decisions**: Keep clear records of permission rules
