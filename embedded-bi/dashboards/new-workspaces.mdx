## What is an Upsolve Workspace?

An Upsolve Workspace is a container that holds multiple related dashboards. Instead of deploying individual dashboards, you can group related dashboards together and deploy them as a single unit.

### Dashboard Types in a Workspace

#### Global Dashboards
- Created by administrators in the Upsolve Hub
- Visible to all users of the workspace
- Read-only for end users (tenants)
- Define the baseline analytics experience

#### Tenant Dashboards
- Created by individual users/tenants when embedded
- Private to each tenant
- Fully editable by the tenant who created them
- Allow for personalized analytics views

---

## Creating Your First Workspace

1. **Navigate to Workspaces**: In the Upsolve Hub, go to your workspace management area
2. **Create New Workspace**: Click the "Create Workspace" button
3. **Initial Dashboard**: The system automatically creates your first dashboard, which becomes the foundation of your workspace
4. **Workspace Properties**: The workspace inherits its name, author, and metadata from this first dashboard

![creating-workspace](/images/workspaces/creating-workspace.png)

**Important:** A workspace is essentially a wrapper around dashboards — it doesn't have independent properties beyond what the dashboards inside it define.

---

## Adding Dashboards to Your Workspace

Once you have a workspace, you can add multiple dashboards:

1. **Use the + Button**: In your workspace view, click the "+" button to create a new dashboard
2. **Dashboard Creation**: This opens the dashboard builder where you can:
   - Add charts and visualizations
   - Configure filters
   - Set dashboard permissions
3. **Automatic Organization**: New dashboards are automatically added to your current workspace

![dashboard-tabs](/images/workspaces/dashboard-tabs.png)
![add-dashboard](/images/workspaces/add-dashboard.png)

**Pro Tip:** The experience your tenants have when adding dashboards will mirror this process — they'll use the same "+" button to create their personal dashboards.

---

## Managing Dashboard Organization

### Moving Dashboards
You can reorganize dashboards between workspaces:

1. **Access Move Function**: Click the "Move" button on any dashboard
2. **Select Destination**: Choose the target workspace from the dropdown
3. **Confirm Move**: The dashboard moves to the new workspace immediately

![move-dashboard](/images/workspaces/move-dashboard.png)

### Important Behaviors
- **Empty Workspaces**: If you move all dashboards out of a workspace, it will automatically disappear from your home screen
- **Workspace Inheritance**: When moved, dashboards adapt to their new workspace's configuration

### Custom Only Workspaces

Control which dashboards are visible to your end users with the Custom Only workspace feature. This is ideal when you want to provide a workspace where users can only see and work with their own personal dashboards, without any global/admin-created dashboards cluttering their view.

#### What is Custom Only Mode?

When a workspace is marked as "Custom Only":
- **Tenant users** see ONLY their personal dashboards (no global dashboards)
- **Admin users** still see all dashboards when in admin view
- **Admins viewing as tenants** see only tenant dashboards (matching tenant experience)
- Global dashboards are hidden from all non-admin users

This feature is perfect for:
- Personal analytics workspaces
- User-specific data exploration environments
- Custom reporting areas where you want complete tenant isolation

#### Setting Up Custom Only Mode (Admin)

1. **Navigate to Your Workspace**: Open the workspace you want to configure in the Upsolve Hub
2. **Access Settings**: Click the settings gear icon in the dashboard header
3. **Toggle Custom Only**: Find and enable the "Custom Only" switch in the settings menu
4. **Confirmation**: The workspace is immediately marked as custom only

![settings-menu-custom-only](/images/workspaces/settings-menu-custom-only.png)
*Caption: The Custom Only toggle in the workspace settings menu*

#### Admin Experience with Custom Only Workspaces

When you mark a workspace as Custom Only, you'll see a prominent red banner on all global dashboards warning you:

> **Custom Only Workspace**  
> This workspace has been marked as "Custom Only". This dashboard will not be visible to any of your users.

![custom-only-banner-admin](/images/workspaces/custom-only-banner-admin.png)
*Caption: Red warning banner shown to admins on global dashboards in Custom Only workspaces*

This banner serves as a visual reminder that any global/admin dashboards you create in this workspace will not be visible to your end users. You can still:
- View and edit all global dashboards
- Switch between admin view and tenant view
- Create new dashboards (they won't be visible to tenants)

#### Tenant Experience with Custom Only Workspaces

When a tenant (end user) accesses a Custom Only workspace:

**If they have created personal dashboards:**
- They see ONLY their own dashboards in tabs
- No global dashboards appear
- They can create new dashboards using the "+" button
- Full editing permissions on their own dashboards (based on your `tenantEditingPermissions`)

![custom-only-tenant-with-dashboards](/images/workspaces/custom-only-tenant-with-dashboards.png)
*Caption: Tenant view of Custom Only workspace showing only personal dashboards*

**If they haven't created any dashboards yet:**
- They see a welcoming empty state screen
- Clear call-to-action to create their first dashboard
- Message: "Welcome to your personal dashboard workspace for [Organization Name]. It looks like you haven't made any dashboards yet."
- Prominent "Create Your First Dashboard" button

![custom-only-empty-state](/images/workspaces/custom-only-empty-state.png)
*Caption: Empty state shown to tenants with no personal dashboards in a Custom Only workspace*

#### When to Use Custom Only Mode

**Use Custom Only for:**
- Personal analytics workspaces where each user builds their own views
- Self-service exploration environments
- Custom reporting areas with complete tenant isolation
- User-specific data sandboxes

**Don't use Custom Only for:**
- Workspaces where you want to provide baseline dashboards to all users
- Shared analytics environments
- Standardized reporting where all users should see the same base dashboards

#### Technical Implementation

The Custom Only flag is stored on the workspace level (not per dashboard).

**Important Notes:**
- The Custom Only toggle affects the ENTIRE workspace
- Existing global dashboards remain in the workspace but become hidden from tenants
- Admins can switch back to admin view at any time to manage global dashboards
- The setting can be toggled on/off without data loss

## Deploying Your Workspace

### Using the UpsolveWorkspace Component

Once your workspace is ready, deploy it using the React component:

```tsx
import { UpsolveWorkspace } from '@upsolve-labs/react';

function MyApp() {
  const userToken = "your-tenant-jwt"; // Replace with your tenant JWT

  return (
    <UpsolveWorkspace
      workspaceId="your-workspace-id"
      tenantJWT={userToken}
      tenantEditingPermissions={{
        addChart: true,
        addFilter: true,
        createChart: true,
        editCharts: true,
        removeChart: true,
        aiCharts: true
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

![deploy-workspace](/images/workspaces/deploy-workspace.png)

### Key Props Explained

- **workspaceId**: The unique identifier of your workspace (found in the Hub)
- **tenantJWT**: Authentication token for your tenant
- **tenantEditingPermissions**: Controls what your users can do:
  - `addChart`: Allow tenants to add charts to their view-only dashboards
  - `addFilter`: Allow tenants to add filters that apply only to their view
  - `createChart`: Allow tenants to create new charts that appear only for them
  - `createChartSQL`: Allow tenants to create charts with SQL (requires `createChart`)
  - `editCharts`: Allow tenants to edit charts in their personal dashboards
  - `removeChart`: Allow tenants to remove charts from their view of a dashboard
  - `readOnly`: Make personal dashboards visible but read-only
  - `disableTabs`: Disable tabbed display in the SDK
  - `aiCharts`: Allow tenants to use AI-powered chart creation
  - `editMarketplace`: Allow tenants to edit marketplace charts
  - `aiInsight`: Allow access to the AI insights chat sidebar

### Getting Your Workspace ID
1. In the Upsolve Hub, navigate to your workspace
2. Click the "Deploy" button
3. Copy the provided workspace ID and integration code

---

## Code Examples

### Basic Workspace Component

```tsx
import { UpsolveWorkspace } from '@upsolve-labs/react';

export function AnalyticsDashboard({ userToken }: { userToken: string }) {
  return (
    <div className="analytics-container">
      <h1>Company Analytics</h1>
      <UpsolveWorkspace
        workspaceId="ws_abc123"
        tenantJWT={userToken}
        tenantEditingPermissions={{
          addChart: true,
          addFilter: true,
          createChart: true,
          editCharts: true,
          removeChart: true,
        }}
        tabPlacement="top" // or "popover"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Advanced Configuration

```tsx
<UpsolveWorkspace
  workspaceId="ws_abc123"
  tenantJWT={userToken}
  tenantEditingPermissions={{
    addChart: true,
    createChart: false, // Users can add existing charts but not create new ones
    editCharts: true,
    readOnly: false
  }}
  theme="dark" // or "light"
  tabPlacement="popover" // Compact dropdown instead of tabs
/>
```

![tenant-view](/images/workspaces/tenant-view.png)

The screenshot below shows what happens when you set `tabPlacement="popover"` — a compact dropdown replaces tabs.

## Alternative Deployment: IFrame Embedding

In addition to the React component approach, you can embed Upsolve Workspaces directly using an iframe. This method is useful for non-React applications or when you need quick integration without installing packages.

### IFrame Deployment

#### Basic IFrame Integration

Instead of using the React component, you can embed workspaces using a standard HTML iframe:

```html
<iframe
  src="https://hub.upsolve.ai/share/dashboard/[DASHBOARD_ID]?personalWorkspace=true&createChart=true"
  width="100%"
  height="600px"
  frameborder="0">
</iframe>
```

Replace `[DASHBOARD_ID]` with your actual dashboard ID from the Upsolve Hub.

#### IFrame Configuration Parameters

Control your workspace behavior using URL parameters:

##### Essential Parameters
- `personalWorkspace=true` - Required to enable workspace functionality with tabs
- `jwt=[YOUR_JWT_TOKEN]` - Authentication token for your users

##### Dashboard Creation Controls
⚠️ Important: To show the "+" button for adding dashboards, you must set `personalWorkspace=true` AND at least one of these permissions:

- `createChart=true` - Allow users to create new charts and dashboards
- `addChart=true` - Allow users to add existing charts to dashboards
- `addFilter=true` - Allow users to add filters to dashboards

##### Additional Permissions
- `editCharts=true` - Allow editing of chart configurations
- `removeChart=true` - Allow removing charts from dashboards
- `aiCharts=true` - Enable AI-powered chart creation
- `readOnly=true` - Personal dashboards visible but read-only
- `disableTabs=true` - Show single dashboard without tabs

##### UI Customization
- `hideHeader=true` - Hide the dashboard header
- `hideDownloadButton=true` - Hide download functionality
- `theme=dark` or `theme=light` - Set color theme
- `globalDashboardName=Custom Name` - Override the global tab name

### Complete IFrame Examples

#### Full-Featured Workspace
```html
<iframe
  src="https://hub.upsolve.ai/share/dashboard/your-dashboard-id?personalWorkspace=true&createChart=true&addChart=true&addFilter=true&editCharts=true&removeChart=true&aiCharts=true&jwt=your-jwt-token"
  width="100%"
  height="800px"
  frameborder="0">
</iframe>
```

#### Read-Only Workspace (No + Button)
```html
<iframe
  src="https://hub.upsolve.ai/share/dashboard/your-dashboard-id?personalWorkspace=true&jwt=your-jwt-token"
  width="100%"
  height="600px"
  frameborder="0">
</iframe>
```

#### Single Dashboard (No Tabs)
```html
<iframe
  src="https://hub.upsolve.ai/share/dashboard/your-dashboard-id?disableTabs=true&hideHeader=true&jwt=your-jwt-token"
  width="100%"
  height="500px"
  frameborder="0">
</iframe>
```

#### Dark Theme with Custom Global Name
```html
<iframe
  src="https://hub.upsolve.ai/share/dashboard/your-dashboard-id?personalWorkspace=true&createChart=true&theme=dark&globalDashboardName=Company Analytics&jwt=your-jwt-token"
  width="100%"
  height="700px"
  frameborder="0">
</iframe>
```

### ⚠️ Important Requirements

#### For Dashboard Creation (+ Button)
The "+" button to add new dashboards will only appear when:
1. `personalWorkspace=true` is set, AND
2. At least one of these permissions is enabled:
   - `createChart=true`
   - `addChart=true`
   - `addFilter=true`

If both conditions aren't met, users will see a read-only workspace without the ability to create new dashboards.

#### Workspace vs Single Dashboard
- With `personalWorkspace=true`: Shows tabbed interface with global + tenant dashboards
- With `disableTabs=true`: Shows single dashboard without tabs
- Default behavior: Shows only the specified dashboard without workspace features

> Looking to deploy multiple workspaces in one app? See the dedicated guide: [Multi-Workspace Deployment](/embedded-bi/dashboards/multi-workspace-deployment).

## Technical Notes

- `UpsolveWorkspace` wraps internal dashboard rendering to provide tabs and workspace context
- Workspaces contain multiple dashboards identified by `workspaceId`
- Each dashboard has a `tenant_id` (null for global, specific ID for tenant dashboards)
- The component automatically handles tab creation and switching
- Global dashboards (tenant_id = null) are read-only for embedded users
- Tenant dashboards are fully editable based on `tenantEditingPermissions`
- Empty workspaces automatically disappear from the Hub interface
- The + button creates new dashboards within the current workspace
- Tab placement can be `top` (traditional tabs) or `popover` (dropdown)
