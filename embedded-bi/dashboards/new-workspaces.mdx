## What is an Upsolve Workspace?

An Upsolve Workspace is a container that holds multiple related dashboards. Instead of deploying individual dashboards, you can group related dashboards together and deploy them as a single unit.

### Dashboard Types in a Workspace

#### Global Dashboards
- Created by administrators in the Upsolve Hub
- Visible to all users of the workspace
- Read-only for end users (tenants)
- Define the baseline analytics experience

#### Tenant Dashboards
- Created by individual users/tenants when embedded
- Private to each tenant
- Fully editable by the tenant who created them
- Allow for personalized analytics views

## Creating Your First Workspace

1. **Navigate to Workspaces**: In the Upsolve Hub, go to your workspace management area
2. **Create New Workspace**: Click the "Create Workspace" button
3. **Initial Dashboard**: The system automatically creates your first dashboard, which becomes the foundation of your workspace
4. **Workspace Properties**: The workspace inherits its name, author, and metadata from this first dashboard

**Important:** A workspace is essentially a wrapper around dashboards — it doesn't have independent properties beyond what the dashboards inside it define.

## Adding Dashboards to Your Workspace

Once you have a workspace, you can add multiple dashboards:

1. **Use the + Button**: In your workspace view, click the "+" button to create a new dashboard
2. **Dashboard Creation**: This opens the dashboard builder where you can:
   - Add charts and visualizations
   - Configure filters
   - Set dashboard permissions
3. **Automatic Organization**: New dashboards are automatically added to your current workspace

![add-dashboard](/images/workspaces/add-dashboard.png)

**Pro Tip:** The experience your tenants have when adding dashboards will mirror this process — they'll use the same "+" button to create their personal dashboards.

---

## Managing Dashboard Organization

### Moving Dashboards
You can reorganize dashboards between workspaces:

1. **Access Move Function**: Click the "Move" button on any dashboard
2. **Select Destination**: Choose the target workspace from the dropdown
3. **Confirm Move**: The dashboard moves to the new workspace immediately

![move-dashboard](/images/workspaces/move-dashboard.png)

### Important Behaviors
- **Empty Workspaces**: If you move all dashboards out of a workspace, it will automatically disappear from your home screen
- **Workspace Inheritance**: When moved, dashboards adapt to their new workspace's configuration

## Deploying Your Workspace

### Using the UpsolveWorkspace Component

Once your workspace is ready, deploy it using the React component:

```tsx
import { UpsolveWorkspace } from '@upsolve-labs/react';

function MyApp() {
  const userToken = "your-tenant-jwt"; // Replace with your tenant JWT

  return (
    <UpsolveWorkspace
      workspaceId="your-workspace-id"
      tenantJWT={userToken}
      tenantEditingPermissions={{
        addChart: true,
        addFilter: true,
        createChart: true,
        editCharts: true,
        removeChart: true,
        aiCharts: true
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

![deploy-workspace](/images/workspaces/deploy-workspace.png)

### Key Props Explained

- **workspaceId**: The unique identifier of your workspace (found in the Hub)
- **tenantJWT**: Authentication token for your tenant
- **tenantEditingPermissions**: Controls what your users can do:
  - `addChart`: Allow tenants to add charts to their view-only dashboards
  - `addFilter`: Allow tenants to add filters that apply only to their view
  - `createChart`: Allow tenants to create new charts that appear only for them
  - `createChartSQL`: Allow tenants to create charts with SQL (requires `createChart`)
  - `editCharts`: Allow tenants to edit charts in their personal dashboards
  - `removeChart`: Allow tenants to remove charts from their view of a dashboard
  - `readOnly`: Make personal dashboards visible but read-only
  - `disableTabs`: Disable tabbed display in the SDK
  - `aiCharts`: Allow tenants to use AI-powered chart creation
  - `editMarketplace`: Allow tenants to edit marketplace charts
  - `aiInsight`: Allow access to the AI insights chat sidebar

### Getting Your Workspace ID
1. In the Upsolve Hub, navigate to your workspace
2. Click the "Deploy" button
3. Copy the provided workspace ID and integration code

## Code Examples

### Basic Workspace Component

```tsx
import { UpsolveWorkspace } from '@upsolve-labs/react';

export function AnalyticsDashboard({ userToken }: { userToken: string }) {
  return (
    <div className="analytics-container">
      <h1>Company Analytics</h1>
      <UpsolveWorkspace
        workspaceId="ws_abc123"
        tenantJWT={userToken}
        tenantEditingPermissions={{
          addChart: true,
          addFilter: true,
          createChart: true,
          editCharts: true,
          removeChart: true,
        }}
        tabPlacement="top" // or "popover"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Advanced Configuration

```tsx
<UpsolveWorkspace
  workspaceId="ws_abc123"
  tenantJWT={userToken}
  tenantEditingPermissions={{
    addChart: true,
    createChart: false, // Users can add existing charts but not create new ones
    editCharts: true,
    readOnly: false
  }}
  theme="dark" // or "light"
  tabPlacement="popover" // Compact dropdown instead of tabs
/>
```

![tenant-view](/images/workspaces/tenant-view.png)

The screenshot below shows what happens when you set `tabPlacement="popover"` — a compact dropdown replaces tabs.

## Technical Notes

- `UpsolveWorkspace` wraps internal dashboard rendering to provide tabs and workspace context
- Workspaces contain multiple dashboards identified by `workspaceId`
- Each dashboard has a `tenant_id` (null for global, specific ID for tenant dashboards)
- The component automatically handles tab creation and switching
- Global dashboards (tenant_id = null) are read-only for embedded users
- Tenant dashboards are fully editable based on `tenantEditingPermissions`
- Empty workspaces automatically disappear from the Hub interface
- The + button creates new dashboards within the current workspace
- Tab placement can be `top` (traditional tabs) or `popover` (dropdown)
