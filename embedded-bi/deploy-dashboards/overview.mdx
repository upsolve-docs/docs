## Overview

To deploy your dashboard, you will need to take the steps laid out below:

1. [Backend Setup](/embedded-bi/deploy-dashboards/backend-setup) - This allows you to set up user authorization for Upsolve AI to provide appropriate data access based on your [tenant](/embedded-bi/data-permissioning/overview#tenants) permissioning set up.
Please refer to [Tenancy Management](/embedded-bi/data-permissioning/tenancy-management) on how to best structure your tenancy.

2. [Frontend Setup](/embedded-bi/deploy-dashboards/frontend-setup) - These frontend setup allows you to embed and deploy your dashboards within your product frontend.

These are required for a _one time setup_ that should take no longer than 30 minutes!
