## User Authorization (Tenant Registration)

The purpose of user authorization set up in the backend is for Upsolve AI to provide appropriate data access based on your user permissioning set up.

In your product's authentication flow, you will need to call the [/register-tenant](/api-reference/endpoint/register-tenant-to-upsolve) endpoint to authorize users/register [tenants](/embedded-bi/data-permissioning/tenancy-management#tenants).
This endpoint allows you to tell Upsolve AI who the authorized user is and what data permission they have via a payload.

The endpoint is a "refresh" endpoint that consumes the payload and issues an one-hour short-lived JWT. This endpoint should be hit every time you re-authorize the user in your app. 
This JWT is then used to provide your authorized users the appropriate access to the dashboard and underlying data.

Please refer to the documentation for the [/register-tenant](/api-reference/endpoint/register-tenant-to-upsolve) endpoint.
You will need to call this endpoint in your auth flow.


<Note>To generate your API Key for the /register-tenant endpoint please go to the deploy page </Note>



<Accordion title="Example: Calling the /register-tenant using Clerk middleware">
Here is an example of doing this using [Clerk middleware](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware#use-after-auth-for-fine-grained-control):
  ```typescript middleware.ts
// This example protects all routes including api/trpc routes
// Please edit this to allow other routes to be public as needed.
// See https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware for more information about configuring your Middleware
export default authMiddleware({
  async afterAuth(auth, req, evt) {
    console.log("Starting login");

    // Handle users who aren't authenticated
    ...

    // Register users to Upsolve
    if (auth.userId && auth.orgId) { // Use this if you need user and org id in your tenant
      console.log("Starting tenant registration");

      // Add Upsolve tenant registration
      const upsolvePayload = {
        displayName: auth.orgSlug, // The public display name for this tenant. Can be user's name, their org, or anything else
        key: auth.orgId, // Private tenant identifier. Could be user id, org id, or anything else
        prefilters: { // Column names to pre-filter raw data on
          store_id: Math.random() > 0.5 ? "1" : "2",
          organization_id: auth.orgSlug,
        },
        schemaPreFilter: "public", // If utilising schema based tenancy please use a schemaPreFilter
        "connectionOverride":{
            "connectionId": "ID of the connection, e.g. Staging, Production"
        },
        apiKey: "up_embed_3...bL9", // Make sure this begind with up_embed_
      };

      // Hit the endpoint
      const upsolveToken = await fetch(
        `https://api.upsolve.ai/v1/api/tenant/register-tenant`,
        {
          method: "POST",
          headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
          },
          body: JSON.stringify(upsolvePayload),
        }
      ).then((res) => res.json())
       .then((data) => data?.["data"]?.["token"]); // Extract the JWT from the response

      // Save the JWT to the user's public metadata, to be used client side!
      await clerkClient.users.updateUser(auth.userId, {
        publicMetadata: { upsolveToken },
      });
      console.log(`Upsolve registration done`);
    }

    // If the user is logged in and trying to access a protected route, allow them to access route
    ...

    // Allow users visiting public routes to access them
    ...
  },
});
```

## Setup Inspection
You could inspect whether the user authorization is setup successfully. Navigate to the **Deploy** application using the side navigation bar.

If the endpoint is successfully called, you should see your new tenants in the **Deploy** application:
