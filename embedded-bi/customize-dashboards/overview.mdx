## Customization Overview

To customize your dashboard, you may use point & click or our SDK editor

### Point & click editor

In the Upsolve Hub, you can use the theme editor to quickly set colors, fonts, border widths, etc.

Anything you save here will automatically propagate into your deployed dashboard, so you can iterate quickly without opening your IDE.

### SDK prop (React only)

For more technical users, use the [SDK guide](sdk) to configure your theme in code.
