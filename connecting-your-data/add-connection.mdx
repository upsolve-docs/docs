This guide will demonstrate how to add a SaaS Connector in Upsolve, using the Upsolve HubSpot Connector as an example. SaaS Connectors enable you to seamlessly integrate and access data from various external sources within your Upsolve project.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Switch to the 'Data Model' mode**: Ensure that you are in the '**Data Model**' mode. If you're not already in this mode, use the switch button located at the top of the page to select it.

2. **Access the SaaS Connector Setup**: In the '**Data Model**' screen, you will see a set of buttons, as shown in the image below. Click on one of these buttons to access the SaaS Connector Setup.
