## Building a Chart via Point and Click

It requires three steps to build a chart:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Select raw table(s)">
    Search and select the relevant raw table(s) needed for visulizing data in your chart.
    ![select-raw-tables](/images/chart-creation/select-raw-tables.png)

    <Tip>

    The list of available raw table(s) is generated after the [data connection](/data-connection/data-connection) is set up and metadata is computed.

    </Tip>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Prepare data">
    Input the relevant SQL to prepare the raw data for data visulization and click **Run query** to execute the code. You can set a specific **Query limit** to constraint
    the length of the resultant table output.
