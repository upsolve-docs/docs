## Building a Chart via Point and Click

It requires four steps to build a chart:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Select raw table(s)">
    Search and select the relevant raw table(s) needed for visulizing data in your chart.
    ![select-raw-tables](/images/charts/select-raw-tables.png)

    <Tip>

    The list of available raw table(s) is generated after the [data connection](/data-connection/data-connection) is set up and metadata is computed.

    </Tip>

  </Accordion>

{" "}
<Accordion title="2. Prepare data">
  Input the relevant SQL to prepare the raw data for data visulization and click
  **Run query** to execute the code. 
  ![prepare-raw-tables](/images/charts/prepare-data.png)
</Accordion>

{" "}
<Accordion title="3. Build chart">
  Select the relevant chart type, and choose the corresponding x- & y-axis
  columns for the charting. See [Chart
  Configuration](/content/charts/area-line-chart) for settings to tailor your
  chart. Click **Save** when you are happy with your chart. You could also
  create a copy of the chart by clicking **Save copy**.

  <Accordion title="4. Configure filters">
    It is now possible to configure chart-level filters, for columns you expect users to interact with. For a more comprehensive overview, check out our [in-depth filtering guide](/filters/filters-in-depth).

## Edit an existing chart

Navigate to the **Library** application using the side navigation bar. Open the chart you want to edit by clicking it, and it will bring you to the
[**Chart Edit**](/charts/point-and-click-interface#building-a-chart-via-point-and-click) screen mentioned above.
