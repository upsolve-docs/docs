This guide will walk you through the process of sharing a read-only copy of your project with friends and colleagues on Upsolve. Recipients will not be able to make changes to the copy of your project; they will receive it as-is.

## Sending a Project Copy

1. **Access the project menu**: Start by locating the project you want to share. Click on the three-dots button (ellipsis icon) associated with the project to open the project menu.

4. **Send the copy**: After composing your message and verifying the recipient's email address, click the 'Send' button to send a read-only copy of your project to the provided email address.

The recipient of the copy of your project will receive a notification, as well, and have the option to either accept or reject the transfer. He/She will be able to see notifications on the '**My Projects**' page, as seen in the image below.

## Receiving and Accepting the Copy

The recipient of the project copy will receive a notification. They have the option to either accept or reject the transfer, as described below:

- **Notification on 'My Projects' page**: The recipient will see a notification on their 'My Projects' page, indicating that they have received an invitation to accept a copy of a project.

- **Accepting the copy**: If the recipient accepts the invitation, the project copy will be added to their 'My Projects' page, where they can view it. However, they will only have read-only access and won't be able to edit the project.
