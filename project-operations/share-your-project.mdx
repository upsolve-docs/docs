This guide explains how you can collaborate with friends and colleagues on Upsolve by sharing your project with them. When you share your project, others can make changes, and you'll be able to see those changes.

## Sharing Your Project

1. **Access the project menu**: To begin sharing your project, locate the project you want to collaborate on. Click on the three-dots button (ellipsis icon) associated with the project to open the project menu.

## Receiving and Managing Shared Projects

The recipient of the project invitation will receive a notification and have the following options:

- **Notification on 'Shared with Me' page**: The recipient will see a notification on their '**Shared with Me**' page, indicating they have received an invitation to join your project.

- **Accepting the invitation**: If the recipient accepts the invitation, the project will be added to their '**My Apps**' page. They can now edit the project, and any changes made will be visible to the project owner and other collaborators.
