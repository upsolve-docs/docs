2. **Define the filter criteria:** In the modal, locate the "WHERE" input field. Here, you can define your filtering criteria to narrow down the data as per your requirements. Additionally, you can use the "ORDER BY" option to sort the data.

3. **Apply the filter:** Once you've configured your filter criteria, click the "Filter" button at the bottom of the modal. This action applies the filter and sorts your data based on your specified criteria.
