This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to join the data from a connector with the data from a Upsolve Table and use the result in your Upsolve application.

## Prerequisites

Before joining data from a connector and a Upsolve Table, ensure that you have the necessary data sources available. You will need:

1. **Upsolve Table:** If you don't have a Upsolve Table yet, you can create one by following this [guide](https://docs.upsolve.com/connecting-your-data/creating-upsolve-table).

2. **Connector data:** You should have data from a connector source. If you don't have any connector data, you can connect your data using a SaaS connector with the help of this [article](https://docs.upsolve.com/connecting-your-data/add-connection).

## Step-by-step Guide

Follow these steps to join and use the data from your connector and Upsolve Table:

1. **Create an SQL query:** You'll need to create a SQL query that combines data from your connector and Upsolve Table. If you're unsure how to create a SQL query, refer to this [guide](https://docs.upsolve.com/connecting-your-data/creating-query).

2. **Execute the query:** Execute the SQL query you've created while clicking on the "Run" button. This query will merge the data from your connector and Upsolve Table.

3. **View the merged data:** Once the query has been executed, you can review the merged data. The results will be displayed as shown in the image below. Additionally, you can access the data in the "Data Model" page under the "Query" tables.
