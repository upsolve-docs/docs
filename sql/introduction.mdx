## Welcome

Upsolve uses Trino's ANSI SQL compliant query engine. This standard compliance allows Upsolve users to integrate their
favorite data tools, including BI and ETL tools with any underlying data source.

Our query engine validates and translates the received SQL statements into the necessary operations on the connected
data source.

This section provides a reference to the supported SQL data types and other general characteristics of the SQL support
of Upsolve.
