Welcome to **Upsolve AI**, your go-to platform for enabling **embedded business intelligence** for your customers. By following this example we will walk you through the essentials of connecting your data, setting up tenancy, building your first dashboard, sharing your insights, and deploying your dashboards in your product.


## Connecting data:


We’ve already set up a **sample dataset** to help you quickly explore and test the platform without needing to connect your own data source. 

To view this connection, please go to the **Connect** tab as seen below:


<Frame>
<img

  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/build-your-first-dashboard/dark/data-connection-hero-dark.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>
</Frame>

If you would like to connect to a different data source, please have a look at how to [set up your connection](data-connection/data-connection).


## Build your first dashboard

In order to build your first dashboard you should begin by creating your first chart before adding to the dashboard. 


### Build your first chart

It requires four steps to build your first chart:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Select raw table(s)">

    Search and select the **aggregations** table. 

    <Frame>
<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/build-your-first-dashboard/light/select-raw-tables.png"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/build-your-first-dashboard/dark/select-raw-tables-dark.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>
</Frame>
    <Tip>

    The list of available raw table(s) is generated after the [data connection](/data-connection/data-connection) is set up.

    </Tip>

  </Accordion>

{" "}
<Accordion title="2. Prepare data">
Click on the **+ aggregations** , this will create ```SQL SELECT * FROM "aggregations" ```   
in the SQL editor.

Click on **Preview data** to run the SQL and **Next** once you see the preview data.
     <Frame>

<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/build-your-first-dashboard/dark/query-builder-dark.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>
    </Frame>


 <Tip>
    If you are more advanced with SQL, you can add more tables and customise your SQL.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

{" "}
<Accordion title="3. Build chart">
  
  For your first chart select a **Grouped bar**, and choose **country** as the x-axis and  **demand** as the y-axis.
  the corresponding x- & y-axis
  
  For future charts see [Chart Configuration](/charts/create-chart) for all chart settings.

  src="/images/build-your-first-dashboard/dark/chart-builder-dark.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"

     </Frame>

</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="4. Configure filters">
    You can set up filters by clicking on **configure filters** and selecting the relevant column and filter type.
    ![configure-filters](/images/filters/filters-guide-4.png)

  Click **Save and add to dashboard** when you are happy with your chart, this will save the chart. You could also
  create a copy of the chart by clicking **Duplicate**.
    <Tip>
    For a more comprehensive overview, check out our [in-depth filtering guide](/filters/filters-in-depth).
    </Tip>
    
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Configure your dashboard

You are able to customise your dashboard by adding dashboard filters, controlled filters and additional charts. 

To resize charts you can simply drag the chart to the size you would like.

To move a chart simply drag and drop the chart.

#### Add dashboard filters

To add a dashboard filter please click on **New Filter**

<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/build-your-first-dashboard/dark/example-dashboard-filter-dark.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>
     </Frame>

#### Add charts

To add additional charts you can go to through the steps of creating a new chart. 

Alternatively if you have already built a chart you can click on **Add Chart** to use on your dashboard.

<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/build-your-first-dashboard/dark/add-chart-dark.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>
     </Frame>




## Share your dashboard

You can share your dashboard via email with anyone in by clicking on the share button and sharing it as follows, if you would like a preview of the dashboard please click on the preview.

Your team members will be invited to your dashboard by sharing your dashboard they will become a team member.

/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/build-your-first-dashboard/dark/share-dark.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>
</Frame>


<Note> If the invitee aceepts the invite, they will gain access to ALL dashboards and data in your organization!</Note>


## User Authorization (Tenant Registration)

To set up **tenant registration** please follow the steps outlined in [Backend Setup](deploy-dashboards/backend-setup). 

Alternatively if you are using our **sample dataset** and do not intend to **go live** with the dashboard this step is optional and you can move to the next step.
### Preview dashboard as your designated end users

If you have completed the [Backend Setup](deploy-dashboards/backend-setup), you are able to view the dashboard as one of your customers.

If you are using the **sample dataset** we have provided two sample tenants, which you are able to preview in the hub below. 

 <Frame>

  <img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/build-your-first-dashboard/light/preview-as-dark.png"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/build-your-first-dashboard/dark/preview-as-dark.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>
     </Frame>

     If you are using the **sample dataset** and want to add more to add more **Preview Tenants**, please click on **Home**, then **Deploy** and then **Registered Tenants**
     
     Click on **Create tenant**
     You can use the following values to simulate creating a tenant:

- **Tenant Display Name**: `{customer-1}`
- **Filter Column**: `{CustomerID}`
- **Filter Value**: `{User_1}`

 <Frame>

  <img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/build-your-first-dashboard/light/create-tenant.png"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/build-your-first-dashboard/dark/create-tenant-dark.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>
 </Frame>


## Deploy your dashboard


Please click on the Deploy button in the Hub.
 <Frame>

  <img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/build-your-first-dashboard/light/deploy.png"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"

  alt="Hero Dark"
/>
 </Frame>


You will need to get the JWT for the current user and the dashboard ID to render the correct dashboard. The JWT is generated by following the steps in Backend Setup. The dashboard ID could be found in the URL when you are viewing the dashboard you want to embed.

Below is an example of deploying component with JWT  using [**Clerk middleware**](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware#use-after-auth-for-fine-grained-control):

```javascript
"use client";
import React from "react";
import { useUser } from "@clerk/nextjs";

const Analytics: React.FC = () => {
  // Get the user information from Clerk and extract the Upsolve token from the metadata
  const { user } = useUser();
  const upsolveToken = user?.publicMetadata?.["upsolveToken"];

  // Embed the component into your app
  return (
    <>
      {upsolveToken != null && typeof upsolveToken === "string" && (
        <iframe
          id="c5da5cb3-fedb-4656-9170-0cc65c9db29a"
          title="Example Dashboard"
          width="1000"
          height="1000"
          src="https://hub.upsolve.ai/share/dashboard/c5da5cb3-fedb-4656-9170-0cc65c9db29a?theme=light&jwt=<upsolveToken>"
        />
      )}
    </>
  );
};

export default Analytics;
```
