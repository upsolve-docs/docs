Welcome to **Upsolve AI**, your go-to platform for enabling **embedded business intelligence** for your customers. By following this example we will walk you through the essentials of connecting your data, setting up tenancy, building your first dashboard, sharing your insights, and deploying your dashboards in your product.


## Connecting data:


We’ve already set up a **sample database** to help you quickly explore and test the platform without needing to connect your own data source. 

To view this connection, please go to the **Connect** tab as seen below:

  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/build-your-first-dashboard/dark/data-connection-hero-dark.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>
</Frame>

If you would like to connect to a different data source, please have a look at how to [set up your connection](data-connection/data-connection).


## Build your first dashboard

In order to build your first dashboard you should begin by creating your first chart before adding to the dashboard. 



### Build your first chart


It requires five steps to build your first chart. In the below example, you will build a grouped bar chart using the aggregations table.
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Select raw table(s)">
  To begin click on **+ New Chart** to open the interface.


Search and select the table(s) that contain the relevant data for the chart you want to create, in this case, aggregations table.

<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/build-your-first-dashboard/dark/select-raw-tables-dark.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>
</Frame>
    <Tip>

    The list of available raw table(s) is generated after the [data connection](/data-connection/data-connection) is set up.

    </Tip>

  </Accordion>

{" "}
<Accordion title="2. Prepare data">

Write any SQL query to transform the table(s) you selected to a single table that you will consume in Step 3 for chart building. You could write SQL to join, filter on table(s) and more.


For this example, you simply want to use the whole **aggregations** table for chart building. Click on the **+ aggregations**,  this will create ```SQL SELECT * FROM "aggregations" ```   
in the SQL editor.

Click on **Preview data** to run the SQL and **Next** once you see the preview data.

<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/build-your-first-dashboard/dark/query-builder-dark.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>
    </Frame>


 <Tip>
    If you are more advanced with SQL, you can add more tables and customise your SQL.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

{" "}
<Accordion title="3. Build chart">

Select the relevant chart type, and choose the corresponding x- & y-axis columns for the charting. This chart will be consumed in step 4 when you create your Chart Filters.
  
  In this example, select a **Grouped bar**, and choose **country** as the x-axis and  **demand** as the y-axis.
  the corresponding x- & y-axis
  
  For future charts see [Chart Configuration](/charts/create-chart) for all chart settings.

     </Frame>

</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="4. Add chart filters">



  To add chart filters you will undertake two steps, firstly deciding the table to filter on and secondly configuring the filter. In this example, we will guide you through both of these steps.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Select Table ">

      In this example we will select the **Computed Table**

      **1. Selected backing tables:** The list of selected backing tables in Step 1 is surfaced here. Filter any column in any selected backing table(s) that is powering this specific chart

**2. Table:** filter any column from the table that was computed by the SQL written in Step 3.

**3. Variables in the chart SQL:** inject variables into the SQL code that is backing this chart

     </Frame>

      </Step>

      

      <Step title="Configure Filter ">


**1. Table:** select the table to filter or "Query variables", in this example select **Computed Table**

**2. Column:** select the column or variable to filter on, in this example select **Country**

**3. Filter:** configure the filter as needed. Options will be provided based on the type of filter selected. In this example chose **Select** and **Select Multi**

### Configure your dashboard

You are able to customise your dashboard by adding dashboard filters, controlled filters and additional charts. 

To resize charts you can hover over the dashboard, and then simply drag the chart to the size you would like. 

To move a chart you can hover over the dashboard, and then simply drag and drop the chart.

#### Add dashboard filters

To add a dashboard filter please click on **New Filter**, 

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="1. Add Filter">
Give your filter a name, and set the type and subtype. In this case, we are going to set a Select filter with single options allowed.

    <Accordion title="2. Select charts">

Select the charts you would like to pass a dashboard filter to. The available charts must have the same chart filter type as your dashboard filter type. Click the green (+) button next to each filter you want to target:

In this example, the Example Chart has a **Select** Filter so we will use this chart.

  </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="3. Filter Preview">
Once you have created your filter, you will be able to add the filter to the dashboard.

You are able to test this by using example values, in this instance we will use **Malaysia**.

## Share your dashboard and collaborate

You can share your dashboard via email **with anyone** by clicking on the share button and sharing it, if you would like a preview of the dashboard please click on the preview.

By sharing your dashboard, they will become a team member of your organization and can view, edit and collaborate on the dashboard(s) with you.

</Frame>


<Note> If the invitee aceepts the invite, they will gain access to ALL dashboards and data in your organization!</Note>


## User Authorization (Tenant Registration)

To set up **tenant registration** please follow the steps outlined in [Backend Setup](deploy-dashboards/backend-setup). 

Alternatively if you are using our **sample database** and do **not intend to go live** with the dashboard this step is optional.
### Preview dashboard as your designated end users


If you have completed the [Backend Setup](deploy-dashboards/backend-setup), you are able to view the dashboard as one of your customers. Please click on the **View As** button in your hub.

If you do not intend to go live with the dashboard, and thus did not setup your backend accordingly, you could use the platform to create a testing tenant instead and preview the dashboard as the testing tenant. We have provided two sample testing tenants for you for the sample database, which you could use to preview the example dashboard built as the tenant.

<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/build-your-first-dashboard/dark/preview-as-dark.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>
     </Frame>

     If you are using the **sample database** and want to add more to add more **Preview Tenants**, please click on **Home**, then **Deploy** and then **Registered Tenants**
     
     Click on **Create tenant**
     You can use the following values to simulate creating a tenant:

- **Tenant Display Name**: `{customer-1}`
- **Filter Column**: `{CustomerID}`
- **Filter Value**: `{User_1}`

 </Frame>

 <Warning> Any created testing tenant would not be available in live environment. They are only for testing purpose within Upsolve AI's purpose. </Warning> 



## Deploy your dashboard


Please click on the Deploy button in the Hub.

You will need to get the JWT for the current user and the dashboard ID to render the correct dashboard. The JWT is generated by following the steps in [Backend Setup](deploy-dashboards/backend-setup). The dashboard ID could be found in the URL when you are viewing the dashboard you want to embed.

Below is an example of deploying component with JWT  using [**Clerk middleware**](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware#use-after-auth-for-fine-grained-control):

```javascript
"use client";
import React from "react";
import { useUser } from "@clerk/nextjs";

const Analytics: React.FC = () => {
  // Get the user information from Clerk and extract the Upsolve token from the metadata
  const { user } = useUser();
  const upsolveToken = user?.publicMetadata?.["upsolveToken"];

  // Embed the component into your app
  return (
    <>
      {upsolveToken != null && typeof upsolveToken === "string" && (
        <iframe
          id="c5da5cb3-fedb-4656-9170-0cc65c9db29a"

          width="1000"
          height="1000"
          src="https://hub.upsolve.ai/share/dashboard/c5da5cb3-fedb-4656-9170-0cc65c9db29a?theme=light&jwt=<upsolveToken>"
        />
      )}
    </>
  );
};

export default Analytics;
```
