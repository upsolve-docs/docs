## **Prerequisites**

To setup CDC between your MySQL database and Upsolve Big Table, you need:

- MySQL version 5.7, 8.0.x

## **Setup Instructions**

### Setting up permissions

In your MySQL primary database, create a database user that must have appropriate permissions on all databases for which the Upsolve CDC captures changes.

1. Create the MySQL user:

```sql
CREATE USER <username>@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';
```

1. Grant the required permissions to the user:

```sql
GRANT SELECT, RELOAD, SHOW DATABASES, REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO <username>@'%';
```

1. Finalize the user’s permissions:

```sql
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### Enabling the binlog

1. Check whether the `log-bin` option is already on:

```sql
// for MySql 5.x
mysql> SELECT variable_value as "BINARY LOGGING STATUS (log-bin) ::"
FROM information_schema.global_variables WHERE variable_name='log_bin';
// for MySql 8.x
mysql> SELECT variable_value as "BINARY LOGGING STATUS (log-bin) ::"
FROM performance_schema.global_variables WHERE variable_name='log_bin';
```

1. If it is `OFF`, configure your MySQL server configuration file with the following properties, which are described in the table below:

```sql
server-id         = 223344 # Querying variable is called server_id,
e.g. SELECT variable_value FROM information_schema.global_variables
WHERE variable_name='server_id';
log_bin           = mysql-bin
binlog_format     = ROW
binlog_row_image  = FULL
expire_logs_days  = 10
```
