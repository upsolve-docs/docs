## Overview

To deploy your dashboard, you will need to take the following steps.
These are required for a _one time setup_ that should take no longer than 30 minutes!

#### [1. Authorize users (register tenants)](#authorize-users-register-tenants)

In your product's authentication flow, you will need to hit the [/register-tenant](/api-reference/endpoint/register-tenant-to-upsolve) endpoint.
This is a "refresh" endpoint that issues a 1h short-lived JWT, so you should be hitting it every time you re-auth the user in your app.

#### [2. Import Upsolve SDK](#import-upsolve-sdk)

The Upsolve team will provide you with a key to use in your `.npmrc` or `.yarnrc` file. You can then import the SDK into your application.

#### [3. Deploy dashboard](#deploy-dashboard)

With the JWT from step (1) and the SDK from step (2) you can call the `<UpsolveDashboard />` component in your app to render it!

## Authorize users (register tenants)

Before you get started, navigate to the Deploy tab in your hub:

![upsolve-deploy](/images/deploy-dashboards/upsolve-deploy.png)

Please see the documentation for the [/register-tenant](/api-reference/endpoint/register-tenant-to-upsolve) endpoint.
You will need to call this endpoint in your auth flow. Here is an example of doing this using [Clerk middleware](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware#use-after-auth-for-fine-grained-control):

```typescript middleware.ts
// This example protects all routes including api/trpc routes
// Please edit this to allow other routes to be public as needed.
// See https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware for more information about configuring your Middleware
export default authMiddleware({
  async afterAuth(auth, req, evt) {
    console.log("Starting login");

    // Handle users who aren't authenticated
    ...

    // Register users to Upsolve
    if (auth.userId && auth.orgId) { // Use this if you need user and org id in your tenant
      console.log("Starting tenant registration");

      // Add Upsolve tenant registration
      const upsolvePayload = {
        displayName: auth.orgSlug, // The public display name for this tenant. Can be user's name, their org, or anything else
        key: auth.orgId, // Private tenant identifier. Could be user id, org id, or anything else
        prefilters: { // Column names to pre-filter raw data on
          store_id: Math.random() > 0.5 ? "1" : "2",
          organization_id: auth.orgSlug,
        },
        apiKey: "up_embed_3...bL9", // Make sure this begind with up_embed_
      };

      // Hit the endpoint
      const upsolveToken = await fetch(
        `https://api.upsolve.ai/v1/api/tenant/register-tenant`,
        {
          method: "POST",
          headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
          },
          body: JSON.stringify(upsolvePayload),
        }
      ).then((res) => res.json())
       .then((data) => data?.["data"]?.["token"]); // Extract the JWT from the response

      // Save the JWT to the user's public metadata, to be used client side!
      await clerkClient.users.updateUser(auth.userId, {
        publicMetadata: { upsolveToken },
      });
      console.log(`Upsolve registration done`);
    }

    // If the user is logged in and trying to access a protected route, allow them to access route
    ...

    // Allow users visiting public routes to access them
    ...
  },
});
```

When this endpoint is successfully called, you should see your new tenants in your Deploy tab:

![tenants](/images/deploy-dashboards/tenants.png)

## Import Upsolve SDK

As the Upsolve team for _a key to the private NPM library_. You will use this key as follows:

If you are using `npm` or `yarn v1`, add your key to your `.npmrc`. _DO NOT COMMIT_ this file (more details [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/using-private-packages-in-a-ci-cd-workflow#create-and-check-in-a-project-specific-npmrc-file)):

```txt .npmrc
@upsolve-labs:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken={YOUR_UPSOLVE_TOKEN}
```

If you are using `yarn v2+`, add your key to your `.yarnrc.yml`. _DO NOT COMMIT_ this file (more details [here](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc)):

```yml .yarnrc.yml
nodeLinker: node-modules

# Use the correct yarn path here based on your version
yarnPath: .yarn/releases/yarn-4.1.0.cjs

npmScopes:
  upsolve-labs:
    npmRegistryServer: "https://npm.pkg.github.com/"
    npmAuthToken: "{YOUR_UPSOLVE_TOKEN}"
```

Now you may run `npm i @upsolve-labs/sdk` or `yarn add @upsolve-labs/sdk` to install the SDK.

## Deploy dashboard

### Tailwind setup

If you don't already have Tailwind installed, please follow the setup instructions here https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation

In your `tailwind.config.js` you will need to make 2 changes:

```javascript tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    ...
    "./node_modules/@tremor/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./node_modules/@upsolve-labs/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./node_modules/flowbite-react/lib/esm/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  ...
  presets: [require("@upsolve-labs/sdk/tailwind.config.js")],
};
```

And make sure, [per the instructions](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation), that in your root .tsx file you have import './output.css' with the output.css file you generated in step 4 of the tailwind setup

### Deploy component with JWT

You will need to get the JWT for the current user and the dashboard ID to render the correct dashboard.
Here is an example of doing this using [Clerk middleware](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware#use-after-auth-for-fine-grained-control):

```typescript Analytics.tsx
"use client";
import React from "react";
import { UpsolveDashboard } from "@upsolve-labs/sdk";
import { useUser } from "@clerk/nextjs";

const Analytics: React.FC = () => {
  // Get the user information from Clerk and extract the Upsolve token from the metadata
  const { user } = useUser();
  const upsolveToken = user?.publicMetadata?.["upsolveToken"];

  // Embed the component into your app
  return (
    <>
      {upsolveToken != null && typeof upsolveToken === "string" && (
        <UpsolveDashboard
          dashboardId={"4cc12f51-1db4-474c-ac14-ba7574ed4ff3"}
          tenantJWT={upsolveToken}
        />
      )}
    </>
  );
};

export default Analytics;
```

### Deploy to production

Make sure that your `.npmrc` or `.yarnrc.yml` values are provided to your deployment as env variables, otherwise the deployment will not work.
