There are two ways to deploy dashboard in your front end:

1. iFrame Embedding
2. Native React Component Embedding ðŸ”’

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="iFrame Embedding">

  Please click on the Deploy button in the Hub.
 <Frame>

  <img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/build-your-first-dashboard/light/deploy.png"
  alt="Hero Light"

<img

 You will need to get the JWT for the current user and the dashboard ID to render the correct dashboard. The JWT is generated by following the steps in Backend Setup. The dashboard ID could be found in the URL when you are viewing the dashboard you want to embed.

Below is an example of deploying component with JWT  usingÂ [**Clerk middleware**](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware#use-after-auth-for-fine-grained-control):

```javascript
"use client";
import React from "react";
import { useUser } from "@clerk/nextjs";

const Analytics: React.FC = () => {
  // Get the user information from Clerk and extract the Upsolve token from the metadata
  const { user } = useUser();
  const upsolveToken = user?.publicMetadata?.["upsolveToken"];

  // Embed the component into your app
  return (
    <>
      {upsolveToken != null && typeof upsolveToken === "string" && (
        <iframe
          id="c5da5cb3-fedb-4656-9170-0cc65c9db29a"
          title="Example Dashboard"
          width="1000"
          height="1000"
          src="https://hub.upsolve.ai/share/dashboard/c5da5cb3-fedb-4656-9170-0cc65c9db29a?theme=light&jwt=<upsolveToken>"
        />
      )}
    </>
  );
};

export default Analytics;
```

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Import Upsolve AI SDK">
        Ask the Upsolve AI team for _"a key to the private NPM library"_. Use the key in your `.npmrc` or `.yarnrc` file. You can then import the SDK into your application.
        Use the key as follows:
        <AccordionGroup>
          <Accordion title="If you are using `npm` or `yarn v1`">
            Add your key to your `.npmrc`. **DO NOT COMMIT** this file (more details [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/using-private-packages-in-a-ci-cd-workflow#create-and-check-in-a-project-specific-npmrc-file)):
            ```txt .npmrc
            @upsolve-labs:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
            //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken={YOUR_UPSOLVE_TOKEN}
            ```
          </Accordion>

          <Accordion title="If you are using `yarn v2+`">
            Add your key to your `.yarnrc.yml`. **DO NOT COMMIT** this file (more details [here](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc)):
            ```yml .yarnrc.yml
            nodeLinker: node-modules

            # Use the correct yarn path here based on your version
            yarnPath: .yarn/releases/yarn-4.1.0.cjs

            npmScopes:
              upsolve-labs:
                npmRegistryServer: "https://npm.pkg.github.com/"
                npmAuthToken: "{YOUR_UPSOLVE_TOKEN}"
            ```
          </Accordion>
        </AccordionGroup>

        Now you may run `npm i @upsolve-labs/sdk` or `yarn add @upsolve-labs/sdk` to install the SDK.

      </Step>
      <Step title="Deploy Dashboard - Tailwind Setup">
        If you don't already have Tailwind installed, please follow the setup instructions [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation). In your `tailwind.config.js` you will need to make 2 changes:

        ```javascript tailwind.config.js
        module.exports = {
          content: [
            ...
            "./node_modules/@tremor/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
            "./node_modules/@upsolve-labs/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
            "./node_modules/flowbite-react/lib/esm/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
          ],
          ...
          presets: [require("@upsolve-labs/sdk/tailwind.config.js")],
        };
        ```

        And make sure, [per the instructions](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation), that in your `root.tsx` file you have imported `./output.css` with the `output.css` file you generated in step 4 of the Tailwind setup.

      </Step>
      <Step title="Deploy Dashboard - Configure global CSS">
        In your main `layout.tsx` or `page.tsx`, add this line to import the Upsolve CSS. For example, if you have a `RootLayout` it will look like this:

        ```typescript layout.tsx
        "use client";
        ...
        import '@upsolve-labs/common/styles/global.css';
        ...

        export default function RootLayout({
          children,
        }:
        ...
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Deploy Dashboard - Deploy component with JWT">
        You will need to get the JWT for the current user and the dashboard ID to render the correct dashboard. The JWT is generated by following the steps in [Backend Setup](/deploy-dashboards/backend-setup).
        The dashboard ID could be found in the URL when you are viewing the dashboard you want to embed.
        
        Below is an example of deploying component with JWT using [Clerk middleware](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware#use-after-auth-for-fine-grained-control):

        ```typescript Analytics.tsx
        "use client";
        import React from "react";
        import { UpsolveDashboard } from "@upsolve-labs/sdk";
        import { useUser } from "@clerk/nextjs";

        const Analytics: React.FC = () => {
          // Get the user information from Clerk and extract the Upsolve token from the metadata
          const { user } = useUser();
          const upsolveToken = user?.publicMetadata?.["upsolveToken"];

          // Embed the component into your app
          return (
            <>
              {upsolveToken != null && typeof upsolveToken === "string" && (
                <UpsolveDashboard
                  dashboardId={"4cc12f51-1db4-474c-ac14-ba7574ed4ff3"}
                  tenantJWT={upsolveToken}
                />
              )}
            </>
          );
        };

        export default Analytics;
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Deploy Dashboard - Deploy to Production">
        Make sure that your `.npmrc` or `.yarnrc.yml` values are provided to your deployment as env variables, otherwise the deployment will not work.
