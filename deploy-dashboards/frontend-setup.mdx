There are two ways to deploy dashboard in your front end:

1. iFrame Embedding
2. Native React Component Embedding

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Import Upsolve AI SDK">
        Ask the Upsolve AI team for _"a key to the private NPM library"_. Use the key in your `.npmrc` or `.yarnrc` file. You can then import the SDK into your application.
        Use the key as follows:
        <AccordionGroup>
          <Accordion title="If you are using `npm` or `yarn v1`">
            Add your key to your `.npmrc`. **DO NOT COMMIT** this file (more details [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/using-private-packages-in-a-ci-cd-workflow#create-and-check-in-a-project-specific-npmrc-file)):
            ```txt .npmrc
            @upsolve-labs:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
            //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken={YOUR_UPSOLVE_TOKEN}
            ```
          </Accordion>

          <Accordion title="If you are using `yarn v2+`">
            Add your key to your `.yarnrc.yml`. **DO NOT COMMIT** this file (more details [here](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc)):
            ```yml .yarnrc.yml
            nodeLinker: node-modules

            # Use the correct yarn path here based on your version
            yarnPath: .yarn/releases/yarn-4.1.0.cjs

            npmScopes:
              upsolve-labs:
                npmRegistryServer: "https://npm.pkg.github.com/"
                npmAuthToken: "{YOUR_UPSOLVE_TOKEN}"
            ```
          </Accordion>
        </AccordionGroup>

        Now you may run `npm i @upsolve-labs/sdk` or `yarn add @upsolve-labs/sdk` to install the SDK.

      </Step>
      <Step title="Deploy Dashboard - Tailwind Setup">
        If you don't already have Tailwind installed, please follow the setup instructions [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation). In your `tailwind.config.js` you will need to make 2 changes:

        ```javascript tailwind.config.js
        module.exports = {
          content: [
            ...
            "./node_modules/@tremor/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
            "./node_modules/@upsolve-labs/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
            "./node_modules/flowbite-react/lib/esm/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
          ],
          ...
          presets: [require("@upsolve-labs/sdk/tailwind.config.js")],
        };
        ```

        And make sure, [per the instructions](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation), that in your `root.tsx` file you have imported `./output.css` with the `output.css` file you generated in step 4 of the Tailwind setup.

      </Step>
      <Step title="Deploy Dashboard - Configure global CSS">
        In your main `layout.tsx` or `page.tsx`, add this line to import the Upsolve CSS. For example, if you have a `RootLayout` it will look like this:

        ```typescript layout.tsx
        "use client";
        ...
        import '@upsolve-labs/common/styles/global.css';
        ...

        export default function RootLayout({
          children,
        }:
        ...
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Deploy Dashboard - Deploy component with JWT">
        You will need to get the JWT for the current user and the dashboard ID to render the correct dashboard. The JWT is generated by following the steps in [Backend Setup](/deploy-dashboards/backend-setup).
        The dashboard ID could be found in the URL when you are viewing the dashboard you want to embed.
        
        Below is an example of deploying component with JWT using [Clerk middleware](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware#use-after-auth-for-fine-grained-control):

        ```typescript Analytics.tsx
        "use client";
        import React from "react";
        import { UpsolveDashboard } from "@upsolve-labs/sdk";
        import { useUser } from "@clerk/nextjs";

        const Analytics: React.FC = () => {
          // Get the user information from Clerk and extract the Upsolve token from the metadata
          const { user } = useUser();
          const upsolveToken = user?.publicMetadata?.["upsolveToken"];

          // Embed the component into your app
          return (
            <>
              {upsolveToken != null && typeof upsolveToken === "string" && (
                <UpsolveDashboard
                  dashboardId={"4cc12f51-1db4-474c-ac14-ba7574ed4ff3"}
                  tenantJWT={upsolveToken}
                />
              )}
            </>
          );
        };

        export default Analytics;
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Deploy Dashboard - Deploy to Production">
        Make sure that your `.npmrc` or `.yarnrc.yml` values are provided to your deployment as env variables, otherwise the deployment will not work.
      </Step>
