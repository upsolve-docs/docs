## What is the 'Set Flow Variable' Node?

The 'Set Flow Variable' node is a vital element in Upsolve that allows you to create variables within the context of a specific flow. These variables are isolated and can only be accessed within the flow where they are created.

## Creating Flow-Specific Variables

To create a flow-specific variable using the 'Set Flow Variable' node, follow these steps:

1. Start by selecting the 'Set Flow Variable' node within your flow.

2. Define the variable you want to create and assign it a value.

That's it! You've now created a variable that is accessible only within the scope of the current flow.

## Conclusion

The 'Set Flow Variable' node enhances the modularity and control of your workflows by enabling you to create and utilize flow-specific variables for various purposes.
