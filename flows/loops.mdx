## Types of Loops

In Upsolve, you can utilize three types of loops to control the flow of your workflow:

### Loop List

The **Loop List** allows you to iterate over each item in an array and execute a series of nodes for each item. Here's how it works:

1. Provide an array of items that you want to loop through in the "Items" field.

2. Specify a variable name in the "Variable Name" field. This variable will represent each item in the array during each iteration.

3. You can access the value of each array item using the variable name you defined.

### Loop Forever

The **Loop Forever** node allows a sequence of nodes to run continuously until a **Break** node is triggered to stop the loop. This type of loop is useful for creating continuous or repeated actions.

### Break

The **Break** node is used to stop the execution of a loop, specifically the **Loop Forever** loop. When a **Break** node is encountered within the loop, the loop stops executing.

## Conclusion

Loops are a powerful tool in Upsolve workflows, enabling you to perform repetitive tasks, iterate through data, and control the flow of your application. Understanding how to use these loop types effectively can enhance your workflow automation capabilities.
