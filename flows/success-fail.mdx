This article provides an introduction to the 'Success' and 'Fail' nodes in Upsolve, explaining their roles in managing the flow and handling success or failure scenarios.

## What are 'Success' and 'Fail' Nodes?

The 'Success' and 'Fail' nodes are critical components in Upsolve workflows that allow you to manage the flow of your application based on success or failure outcomes.

When the 'Success' node is executed, it signifies that a particular operation or task has been successfully completed, and it typically marks the end of a successful branch in your workflow.

The 'Fail' node, on the other hand, indicates that an operation has failed or encountered an error. When the 'Fail' node is triggered, it will stop the faulty flow.

You can customize the error message or response by specifying parameters in the 'Fail' node.
