Upsolve offers two complementary products:

- Embedded BI: Point‑and‑click analytics to build charts and dashboards your customers can use inside your app.
- AI Agent Builder: A data‑aware AI that turns natural language into SQL, analysis, and charts.

How to use them:

- Separately: Ship a classic dashboard experience, or ship an AI chat experience.
- Together: Let users chat to explore data, save great results as charts, and surface them in dashboards.
