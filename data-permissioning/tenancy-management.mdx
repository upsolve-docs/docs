## Overview
Upsolve AI is **data source agnostic**, meaning you can populate data from multiple data sources into a single dashboard. 
To ensure that each end users only sees the data relevant to them, youâ€™ll need to set up **tenancy filters**.

These filters allow you to isolate the data your end useres can view based on the specific characteristics you've defined for each of them. 
By doing so, you provide each user with a tailored dashboard experience while maintaining strict control over data access.

## Tenants

A Tenant refers to a distinct group of end users that share the same data access and permission. The benefits of Upsolve AI's tenancy management include:

- **Security**: Letting Upsolve AI know what data users should have access to ensures users are restricted to only seeing the data meant for them
- **Easy Management:** By using tenants, you can assign permissions and filters to each group, streamlining data management.
- **Consistency:** Automatically applied filters ensure all tenants in the same group follow the same data access rules.

## Tenant Registation (User Authorization)
You could register a tenant following the [Backend Setup](/deploy-dashboards/backend-setup) instruction.

## Tenant Preview
Upsolve AI allows you to simulate the registration of individual tenant and then preview the dashboard as that tenant.
