##¬†Install Trino JDBC Driver

Upsolve connector requires Trino JDBC driver to be installed. You can install Trino JDBC Driver by clicking [here](https://trino.io/docs/current/client/jdbc.html).

In the Trino page, you can download the the driver by clicking link highlighted in the image below:

<img src="https://cdn.peaka.com/bi-tools/tableau/tableau-1.png" />

JDBC drivers are self-contained .jar files. Place the Trino JDBC Driver in the folder for your operating system. (You need to create the folder if it doesn't already exist.)

- Windows: C:\Program Files\Tableau\Drivers
- Mac: ~/Library/Tableau/Drivers
- Linux: /opt/tableau/tableau_driver/jdbc

üí° You must have read permissions on the .jar file.

## Configure Tableau Start Script

Tableau requires taco file to be signed. Currently, Upsolve Connector taco file is not signed by a certificate authority. We are working on it. However you can still use Upsolve Connector by passing a parameter to Tableau executable. Follow these steps to run Upsolve Connector:

### For Mac:

Open terminal and create a **tableau.sh** file with this command:

```javascript
   mkdir tableau.sh
```

Open **tableau.sh** file with a text editor and copy the code below:

```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    "/Applications/Tableau Desktop <Tableau Version>.app/Contents/MacOS/Tableau" -DDisableVerifyConnectorPluginSignature=true
```

Change < Tableau Version > with the version of the Tableau you are using. Save and close the file. Make the **tableu.sh** executable by running this command:

```bash
    chmod +x
```

Now you should be able to run [tableau.sh](http://tableau.sh) script and start Tableau Desktop by running the command below:

```bash
    sh tableau.sh
```

###¬†For Windows:

Open command line and run the command below change < ableau Version > with your tableau version:

```bash
    C:\Program Files\Tableau\Tableau <Tableau Version>\bin\tableau.exe -DDisableVerifyConnectorPluginSignature=true
```
