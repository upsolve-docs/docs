You need 2 steps to complete setup:

- Generate Upsolve API Key
- Add Upsolve as Database Connection

## Generate API Key

After you create your project, setup connections and create your catalogs in Upsolve, you need to generate a Upsolve API Key to use it with Superset.
Check out Upsolve Documentation for creating your API Key and follow detailed instructions by clicking [here](https://docs.upsolve.com/how-to-guides/how-to-generate-api-keys).

## Add Upsolve as Database Connection

- Adding Upsolve as Database Connection to Superset is so easy. In your main dashboard in Superset, click Setting and then click Database Connections.
  Then in the next screen click Database button on the top right corner of your screen.

- In the next screen you need to enter Display Name and SQL Alchemy URI. You can enter anything you like for the Display Name.The SQL Alchemy URI format is like below:

**Note:** If you are using Upsolve in EU, you need to use `trino://dbc.eu.upsolve.studio:4567` instead of `trino://dbc.upsolve.studio:4567`.

`trino://dbc.upsolve.studio:4567/<catalog>/<schema>?http_scheme=https&extra_credential=[[”upsolveKey”,”<YOUR_API_KEY>”]]&access_token=true`

You need to fill `<catalog>`, `<schema>` and `<YOUR_API_KEY>`. For example if I want to see work on the tables under stripe catalog and payment schema created in Upsolve with API Key `abc` , then my SQL Alchemy URI would look like below:

`trino://dbc.upsolve.studio:4567/stripe/payment?http_scheme=https&extra_credential=[[”upsolveKey”,”abc”]]&access_token=true`

Then click `Test Connection` button to test the connection and if the connection is ok, then click `Connect` button.
