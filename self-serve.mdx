# Set up customer groups:

Upsolve is **data source agnostic**, meaning you can integrate multiple data sources into a single dashboard. To ensure that each tenant only sees the data relevant to them, youâ€™ll need to set up **tenancy filters**.

These filters allow you to isolate the data your tenants can view based on the specific characteristics you've defined for each customer group. By doing so, you provide each tenant with a tailored dashboard experience while maintaining strict control over data access.

### Why register your users (tenants) with Upsolve?

A **tenant** refers to a distinct group or organisation that has its own isolated set of data, configurations, and users. For each given tenant, you will have a **customer group** that has the same permissioning to given data.

- **Security**: Letting Upsolve AI know what data users should have access to ensures users are restricted to only seeing the data meant for them.
- **Easy Management**: By using tenants, you can assign permissions and filters to each group, streamlining data management.
- **Consistency**: Automatically applied filters ensure all tenants in the same group follow the same data access rules.

<Note>
Using customer groups ensures that each tenantâ€™s experience is secure, relevant, and tailored to their needs while simplifying management for yourselves.
