## What You'll Get

- **Chat with your data**: Ask questions like "What were our top sales this quarter?" in natural language
- **Automatic insights**: The agent writes SQL, runs it, analyzes results, and creates charts
- **Smart learning**: Save good examples as "Golden Assets" so the agent gets more consistent over time
- **Quality control**: Test the agent with known answers before rolling it out

## Who This Is For

- **Business users** who want to explore data without writing SQL
- **Product teams** building data features into their apps
- **Developers** creating AI agents that need to work with databases

## Supported Data Sources

Connect to any SQL database: **Postgres**, **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **Redshift**, **MySQL**, and more. We also support business APIs like **Stripe**, **HubSpot**, and **PostHog** on request.

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Connect Your Data
Choose which tables the agent can access from your database.

    alt="Data catalog interface showing table selection"

 </Frame>

### Step 2: Mark Key Columns
Select columns with human-friendly values (like "product_name" or "region") that users might want to filter by. Skip technical IDs and timestamps.

### Step 3: Start Asking Questions
Use the chat interface to ask about your data. The agent will show you each step: generating SQL, running it, and analyzing results.

    alt="Full conversation showing question, SQL, results, and analysis"
  />
 </Frame>

### Step 4: Save What Works
When the agent gets something right (or when you fix it), save it as a Golden Asset so it performs consistently on similar questions.

<Frame>
  <img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/ai-builder/img-5.png"
    alt="Save to Golden Assets dialog"
  />
  <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/ai-builder/img-5.png"
    alt="Save to Golden Assets dialog"
  />
 </Frame>

### Step 5: Test Before Launch
Create evaluation test sets with known correct answers, then run tests to make sure the agent performs well at scale.

  <img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/ai-builder/img-6.png"
    alt="Evaluations dashboard"
  />

## Next Steps

- Try the admin chat to see the full reasoning behind each answer
- Create your first Golden Assets from successful conversations
- Set up evaluations with a few ground-truth examples
- **For developers**: See the [Technical Guide](tech-guide) for embedding options and API details
