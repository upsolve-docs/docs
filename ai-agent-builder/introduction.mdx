## What is the Data-Aware Agent Builder?

The Data-Aware Agent Builder is a platform that lets you create AI agents capable of turning natural language questions into accurate SQL queries, analyzing results, and generating insights. Whether you're building a "chat with data" feature for your product or need an internal analyst assistant, this platform provides the tools to make your AI data-aware.

## Key Capabilities

- **Natural Language to SQL**: Your agent converts questions like "What were our top products last quarter?" into accurate SQL queries
- **Automatic Analysis**: Analyzes query results and extracts key insights without manual intervention  
- **Chart Generation**: Creates appropriate visualizations based on the data and question context
- **Learning System**: Improves over time through Golden Assets that capture successful question-answer patterns
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in evaluation tools to test your agent before deployment

## What's in These Docs

These documentation guides will help you:

1. **Get Started Quickly** - Connect your data and start asking questions in minutes
2. **Build Golden Assets** - Create examples that make your agent more consistent and accurate
3. **Set Up Evaluations** - Test your agent's performance with ground-truth comparisons
4. **Choose Integration** - Deploy as a standalone app, embed in your product, or use headless APIs
5. **Optimize Performance** - Configure selectable columns and manage data access for best results

Whether you're a business user exploring data or a developer building AI features, these guides provide step-by-step instructions to get your data-aware agent up and running.
