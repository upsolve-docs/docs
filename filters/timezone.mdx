## Overview

Dashboards can be configured to use appropriate timezones to contextualise data to your end user's location. By default, your dashboard will be configured to read the local time of your end user. Upsolve, when piping data from your data source to your dashboard, will shift any date columns towards the timezone of the end user. You must store all your data in UTC time.

### Setting a specific timezone

If you would like all your end users to see data in the same timezone, you can set a specific timezone inside the settings dropdown in your dashboard builder. You can also change back to using the end user's timezone by selecting **local**.
